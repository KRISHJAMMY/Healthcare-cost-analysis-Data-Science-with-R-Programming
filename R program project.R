## Analysis Conclusion:
  As is evident in the multiple models above, health care costs is dependent on age, length of stay and the diagnosis type.
Healthcare cost is the most for patients in the 0-1 yrs age group category
Maximum expenditure for 0-1 yr is 678118
Length of Stay increases the hospital cost

All Patient Refined Diagnosis Related Groups also affects healthcare costs

640 diagnosis related group had a max cost of 437978
Race or gender doesnâ€™t have that much impact on hospital cost
